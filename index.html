    <h1>Welcome to the Weebtaku offical website!</h1>
<p Our mission is talk about some anime and other nerd like things. Also it is very fun to do so.

    <h1> So what is a podcast? </h2>
    <p> A podcast or generically netcast, is an episodic series of digital audio or video files which a user can download in order to listen to. It is often available for subscription, <br>hat new episodes are automatically downloaded via web syndication to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or portable media player.

The word was originally suggested by Ben Hammersley as a portmanteau of "iPod" (a brand of media player) and "broadcast".
    <h1> Why the name weebtaku? </h3>
    <p> The first time I heard of the name weeb was with one of my cousins and we were at a Mexican restaurant. He knew that I was into watching anime. So we we're just hanging out and then he said to me “John you are a weeb.” Me confused at the moment not knowing what he meant by it. So I asked him what does that mean. So he gave the explanation and was kind of upset about it. But later on I learned what the word otaku was for. So in my mind it just sounded a lot better. <br>So if anyone would ask if I was a weeb I would say “I prefer to be called an otaku." Anyway we were talking about a name. So we made the name weebtaku. The reason for that was because I like to be called otaku and my cousin likes to be called weeb. So we just did a fusion dance with the words and boom we have our name. Then the world was never the same again.
