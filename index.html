    <h2> So what is a podcast? </h2>
    <p> A podcast or generically netcast, is an episodic series of digital audio or video files which a user can download in order to listen to. It is often available for subscription, <br>hat new episodes are automatically downloaded via web syndication to the user's own local computer, mobile application, or portable media player.

The word was originally suggested by Ben Hammersley as a portmanteau of "iPod" (a brand of media player) and "broadcast".
